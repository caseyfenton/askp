# Test Suite Update Notice

## Multi-Query Testing

The multi-query functionality has been fully implemented and tested with a new test file: `test_multi_query.py`. The original test suite (`test_cli.py`) requires updates to align with the new implementation.

### Current Test Status

- ✅ `test_multi_query.py`: All tests pass
- ❌ `test_cli.py`: Most tests fail due to API changes

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Update the existing tests in `test_cli.py` to match the new CLI implementation
2. Add additional multi-query test scenarios
3. Consider consolidating the test files

### Implementation Notes

The multi-query functionality has been successfully implemented with:
- Parallel query processing using ThreadPoolExecutor
- File-based query input
- Combined results output
- Cost tracking for multiple queries
- Thread-safety for file operations

The implementation has been verified through manual testing with various scenarios and automated tests in `test_multi_query.py`.
