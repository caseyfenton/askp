{queries_str}

Generate {num_new_queries} additional, diverse queries that will complement these and help the user get to a solution to their problem or a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.

The new queries should:
1. First, focus on providing a more comprehensive understanding of this topic
2. Identify specific solutions to and around the problem
3. Consider time-sensitive aspects (recent updates, changes, or developments)
4. Take into account that technical solutions may require up-to-date information (e.g., coding solutions from a few years ago may be outdated)
5. Cover different aspects not addressed in the original queries
6. Fill knowledge gaps in the original set
7. Be specific and focused
8. Be directly related to the overall research topic
9. Not duplicate information in the original queries
10. Drive toward practical, actionable solutions when applicable

Return your response as a JSON object with a single key "queries" containing an array of strings.
Example format:
{{
  "queries": [
    "First additional query",
    "Second additional query",
    ...
  ]
