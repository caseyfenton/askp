# Perplexity API Research - New Features Analysis

## Research Date: September 28, 2025

### Key Findings: New Perplexity API Features (2024-2025)

#### Major Updates
1. **Standalone Search API** (September 2025) - Raw search results without LLM processing at $5/1000 requests
2. **Sonar Model** (February 2025) - In-house AI model based on Meta Llama 3.3 70B with 128k context
3. **Enhanced Document Support** - PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF processing
4. **API Key Rotation** - New security features

#### Real-World Usage Patterns
- **Multi-query batch processing**: Up to 5 queries per API call for systematic research
- **Structured data extraction**: Metadata-rich responses (title, URL, date, snippets)
- **Agent-based workflows**: AI agents using Search API for multi-step investigations
- **Research automation**: Academic and business intelligence applications

#### Developer Feedback
**Strengths:**
- Citation-first approach with transparent sourcing
- Structured API responses ideal for agent integration
- Real-time index updates (tens of thousands per second)
- Advanced filtering (domains, dates, regions, academic mode)

**Limitations:**
- Less conversational than chat APIs
- Higher integration complexity
- Limited initial programming language support
- Privacy/compliance concerns

#### ASKP Integration Assessment

**Current State:** âœ… ASKP already compatible - no critical updates needed

**High-Value Integration Opportunities:**
1. `--search-mode` flag for raw search results without AI processing
2. `--batch-research` mode for multi-query research automation
3. `--citations-only` mode for structured bibliography generation
4. Enhanced filtering options (domain, date, academic sources)

**Strategic Value:**
- Differentiates ASKP as CLI-first research tool vs web competitors (Phind, Exa)
- Enables terminal-native batch research workflows
- Provides scriptable research automation capabilities
- Complements existing chat-based functionality rather than replacing it

#### Competitive Analysis
ASKP's unique positioning as a **CLI-first research automation tool** makes it well-suited to leverage the new Search API capabilities. Unlike web-based competitors, ASKP can offer:
- Terminal-integrated research workflows
- Shell pipeline compatibility
- Batch processing automation
- Structured output for downstream processing

#### Recommendation
**Proceed with integration** - The new Search API offers genuinely different capabilities that would enhance ASKP's research automation strengths. Implementation priority:
1. Basic `--search-only` flag (Phase 1)
2. Multi-query batch mode (Phase 2)
3. Advanced filtering and citation export (Phase 3)
